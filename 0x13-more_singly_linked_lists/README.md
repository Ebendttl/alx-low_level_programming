# 0x13-more_singly_linked_lists

This project explores the concept of singly linked lists in C programming language and extends the functionalities of basic linked lists.

## Description

The repository contains C programs that demonstrate various operations and manipulations on singly linked lists. It includes functions to insert nodes at different positions, delete nodes, traverse the list, find elements, and more.

## File Descriptions

- `lists.h`: Header file containing function prototypes, struct definitions, and included libraries.
- `0-print_listint.c`: Function to print all elements of a linked list.
- `1-listint_len.c`: Function to return the number of elements in a linked list.
- ... (Other files contain different functionalities or operations on linked lists)

## Compilation

All C files can be compiled using `gcc`:

```bash
$ gcc -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic *.c -o linked_list
