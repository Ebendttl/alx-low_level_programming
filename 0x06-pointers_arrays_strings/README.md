# 0x06-pointers_arrays_strings

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the concepts of pointers, arrays, and strings. It covers various tasks and challenges related to these topics.

## Tasks

1. **0-reset_to_98.c**: A function that takes a pointer to an int as a parameter and updates the value it points to 98.
2. **1-swap.c**: A function that swaps the values of two integers.
3. **2-strlen.c**: A function that returns the length of a string.
4. **3-puts.c**: A function that prints a string to the standard output followed by a new line.
5. **4-print_rev.c**: A function that prints a string, in reverse, followed by a new line.
6. **5-rev_string.c**: A function that reverses a string.
7. **6-puts2.c**: A function that prints every other character of a string, starting from the first character.
8. **7-puts_half.c**: A function that prints the second half of a string.
9. **8-print_array.c**: A function that prints n elements of an array of integers, followed by a new line.
10. **9-strcpy.c**: A function that copies the string pointed to by `src`, including the terminating null byte, to the buffer pointed to by `dest`.

## Usage

You can compile the C programs using a C compiler like `gcc`. For example, to compile `0-reset_to_98.c`, you can use the following command:

```bash
gcc -Wall -Werror -pedantic -o 0-reset_to_98 0-reset_to_98.c
