# 0x08. C - Recursion

## Description

This repository contains C programs that demonstrate the concept of recursion. Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself in order to solve a problem. This project explores various recursive algorithms and their implementations in the C programming language.

## Files

- **0-puts_recursion.c**: A C program that prints a string followed by a new line using recursion.
- **1-print_rev_recursion.c**: A C program that prints a string in reverse using recursion.
- **2-strlen_recursion.c**: A C program that returns the length of a string using recursion.
- **3-factorial.c**: A C program that calculates the factorial of a number using recursion.
- **4-pow_recursion.c**: A C program that calculates the value of `x` raised to the power of `y` using recursion.
- **5-sqrt_recursion.c**: A C program that calculates the square root of a number using recursion.
- **6-is_prime_number.c**: A C program that checks if a number is a prime number using recursion.
- **7-is_palindrome.c**: A C program that checks if a string is a palindrome using recursion.
